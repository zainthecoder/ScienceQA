For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals or rocks.\\nHumans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.\\nA mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.\\nA pure substance is made of only one type of matter. Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.\\nA mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.\\nThe crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.\\nHowever, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different! Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.\\nGranodiorite is a rock.\\nA brick is not a rock.\\nLimestone is a rock.",

    "2382": "The answer is A. BECAUSE: Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.\\nMinerals and rocks have the following properties:\\nProperty | Mineral | Rock\\nIt is a solid. | Yes | Yes\\nIt is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes\\nIt is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes\\nIt is a pure substance. | Yes | No\\nIt has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No\\nYou can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.\\nLook closely at the last three properties:\\nMinerals and rocks are not made by organisms.\\nOrganisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals or rocks.\\nHumans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.\\nA mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.\\nA pure substance is made of only one type of matter. Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.\\nA mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.\\nThe crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.\\nHowever, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different! Compare the properties of scoria to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.\\nScoria has no fixed crystal structure. But all minerals have a fixed crystal structure.\\nScoria has many small holes. But minerals do not have holes.\\nScoria is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.\\nSo, scoria is not a mineral.",

    "3846": "The answer is B. BECAUSE: You can use a ratio to compare the speeds of two objects.\\nThe speed of an object is how fast the object is moving.\\nYou can find the speed of an object by dividing the distance the object travels by the time it takes to travel that distance.\\nSpeed = Distance/Time\\nFor example, if an object travels 100 meters in 10 seconds, its speed is 100/10, or 10 meters per second.\\nYou can use a ratio to compare the speeds of two objects.\\nTo do this, find the speed of each object. Then, compare the speeds using a ratio.\\nFor example, if one car travels 100 kilometers in 2 hours, its speed is 100/2, or 50 kilometers per hour.\\nIf another car travels 200 kilometers in 4 hours, its speed is 200/4, or 50 kilometers per hour.\\nThe ratio of the two speeds is 50/50, or 1. So, the two cars are traveling at the same speed.\\nNow try the following problem.\\nCompare the motion of three cars. Which car was moving at the lowest speed?\\nCar A traveled 250 miles in 5 hours.\\nCar B traveled 65 miles in 5 hours.\\nCar C traveled 300 miles in 5 hours.\\nFirst, find the speed of each car.\\nCar A: 250 miles in 5 hours\\nCar A's speed = 250/5 = 50 miles per hour\\nCar B: 65 miles in 5 hours\\nCar B's speed = 65/5 = 13 miles per hour\\nCar C: 300 miles in 5 hours\\nCar C's speed = 300/5 = 60 miles per hour\\nNext, compare the speeds using ratios.\\nThe ratio of Car A's speed to Car B's speed is 50/13.\\nThe ratio of Car A's speed to Car C's speed is 50/60.\\nThe ratio of Car B's speed to Car C's speed is 13/60.\\nSince the ratio of Car B's speed to Car C's speed is the smallest, Car B was moving at the lowest speed.",

    "5789": "The answer is C. BECAUSE: Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.\\nMinerals and rocks have the following properties:\\nProperty | Mineral | Rock\\nIt is a solid. | Yes | Yes\\nIt is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes\\nIt is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes\\nIt is a pure substance. | Yes | No\\nIt has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No\\nYou can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.\\nLook closely at the last three properties:\\nMinerals and rocks are not made by organisms.\\nOrganisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals or rocks.\\nHumans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.\\nA mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.\\nA pure substance is made of only one type of matter. Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.\\nA mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.\\nThe crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.\\nHowever, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different! Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.\\nQuartz is a mineral.\\nHornblende is a mineral.\\nA skull is not a mineral.",

    "6188": "The answer is A. BECAUSE: A complete sentence has two parts:\\n1. a subject (the noun or pronoun that is doing the verb)\\n2. a predicate (the verb or verb phrase that happens to the subject)\\nThe subject of a sentence is usually a noun or pronoun. The predicate is the verb or verb phrase that happens to the subject.\\nFor example, in the sentence \u201cThe dog barks,\u201d the subject is \u201cdog\u201d and the predicate is \u201cbarks.\u201d\\nIn the sentence \u201cI am happy,\u201d the subject is \u201cI\u201d and the predicate is \u201cam happy.\u201d\\nSometimes, a sentence can have more than one verb, but only one verb can be the main verb. The main verb is the verb that happens to the subject.\\nFor example, in the sentence \u201cI am eating an apple,\u201d the main verb is \u201ceating\u201d and the other verb is \u201cam.\u201d\\nIn the sentence \u201cI am eating an apple,\u201d the subject is \u201cI\u201d and the main verb is \u201ceating.\u201d The other verb, \u201cam,\u201d happens to the subject \u201cI\u201d too, but it is not the main verb.\\nIn the sentence \u201cI am eating an apple,\u201d the predicate is \u201cam eating an apple.\u201d\\nA sentence can also have a compound subject, which is two or more subjects that are doing the same verb.\\nFor example, in the sentence \u201cThe dog and the cat are sleeping,\u201d the compound subject is \u201cthe dog and the cat\u201d and the predicate is \u201care sleeping.\u201d\\nIn the sentence \u201cThe dog and the cat are sleeping,\u201d the main verb is \u201care sleeping\u201d and the other verb is \u201c sleeping.\u201d\\nIn the sentence \u201cThe dog and the cat are sleeping,\u201d the subject is \u201cthe dog and the cat\u201d and the main verb is \u201care sleeping.\u201d\\nSo, a complete sentence must have a subject and a predicate. The subject is usually a noun or pronoun, and the predicate is the verb or verb phrase that happens to the subject. A sentence can also have a compound subject.",
    "6193": "The answer is A. BECAUSE: Pronouns are words that stand in for other nouns. They can make your writing clearer and more concise.\\nHowever, pronouns can also create problems in writing. One problem is called a vague pronoun reference.\\nA vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one noun. This can make your writing confusing.\\nFor example, consider the following sentence:\\nSeveral competent city council members have been elected in Oakland, but the mayor's office has prevented the council members from significantly influencing policy.\\nThe pronoun \"them\" could refer to \"several competent city council members\" or \"the council members.\" This creates a vague pronoun reference.\\nTo fix a vague pronoun reference, you can either use a different pronoun or rephrase the sentence.\\nFor example, you could use the pronoun \"those\":\\nSeveral competent city council members have been elected in Oakland, but the mayor's office has prevented those members from significantly influencing policy.\\nOr you could rephrase the sentence:\\nSeveral competent city council members have been elected in Oakland, but the mayor's office has prevented the council members from significantly influencing policy.\\nIn this sentence, the pronoun \"those\" refers to \"several competent city council members.\" This is not a vague pronoun reference.",

    "6863": "The answer is C. BECAUSE: The speed of an object is how fast it is moving. You can calculate the speed of an object using the following equation:\\nspeed = distance/time\\nFor example, if an object travels 100 meters in 10 seconds, its speed is 100/10, or 10 meters per second.\\nTo compare the speeds of different objects, you can use the equation above.\\nFirst, find the distance each object traveled.\\nThen, find the time each object took to travel that distance.\\nFinally, divide the distance by the time for each object. The object with the highest speed will have the highest value for distance/time.\\nIn this problem, you are given the distance and time for each bicycle. Use the equation above to find the speed of each bicycle.\\nBicycle A traveled 155 miles in 10 hours. So, its speed is 155/10, or 15.5 miles per hour.\\nBicycle B traveled 315 miles in 10 hours. So, its speed is 315/10, or 31.5 miles per hour.\\nBicycle C traveled 325 miles in 10 hours. So, its speed is 325/10, or 32.5 miles per hour.\\nBicycle C was moving at the highest speed.",

This means that there are not enough houses for everyone who wants to buy one.\\nWhen more people move out of a city than move in, the city's population decreases. This can cause the demand for housing to go down.\\nMore people moving out of a city than moving in can also cause the city's housing market to loosen. This means that there are more houses for sale than there are people who want to buy them.\\nThe number of people moving into or out of a city can also affect the city's overall supply of houses for sale.\\nWhen more people move into a city than move out, the city's population grows. This can cause the overall supply of houses for sale to go down.\\nWhen more people move out of a city than move in, the city's population decreases. This can cause the overall supply of houses for sale to go up.\\nLast year, 50,000 people lived in the city of Millersburg. But since then, 8,000 people have moved away.

    "7238": "The answer is A. BECAUSE: The speed of an object is how fast it moves. You can calculate the speed of an object using the following equation:\\nspeed = distance/time\\nFor example, if an object travels 100 kilometers in 2 hours, its speed is 100 kilometers/2 hours, or 50 kilometers per hour.\\nYou can use this equation to compare the speeds of two objects.\\nFor example, if one object travels 100 kilometers in 2 hours and another object travels 200 kilometers in 4 hours, which object is moving faster?\\nTo find out, compare the distances each object travels in the same amount of time. In this case, both objects travel 100 kilometers in 2 hours. So, they are moving at the same speed.\\nNow, compare the speeds of the two trains.\\nThe first train travels 835 kilometers in 10 hours. So, its speed is 835 kilometers/10 hours, or 83.5 kilometers per hour.\\nThe second train travels 945 kilometers in 10 hours. So, its speed is 945 kilometers/10 hours, or 94.5 kilometers per hour.\\nThe second train is moving faster than the first train.",

    "8371": "The answer is B. BECAUSE: The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only be transferred from one object to another.\\nIn this activity, you will use the law of conservation of energy to explain how thermal energy is transferred.\\nThermal energy is the energy of moving particles. The faster the particles move, the more thermal energy they have.\\nAll matter is made of particles. So, all matter has thermal energy.\\nWhen two objects are in contact, thermal energy is transferred from the object with more thermal energy to the object with less thermal energy.\\nIn this activity, the battery with the higher temperature has more thermal energy than the battery with the lower temperature. So, thermal energy is transferred from the battery with the higher temperature to the battery with the lower temperature.\\nThe battery with the higher temperature loses thermal energy. The battery with the lower temperature gains thermal energy.\\nThe surroundings do not gain or lose thermal energy. So, the answer is B.",

Instead, all rocks are mixtures.\\nA mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.\\nThe crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.\\nHowever, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different! Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals.

Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way.\\nLater in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there.

For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals or rocks.\\nHumans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.\\nA mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.\\nA pure substance is made of only one type of matter. Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.\\nA mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.\\nThe crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.\\nHowever, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different! Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.\\nConglomerate is not made by living things. It is formed in nature.

For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals or rocks.\\nHumans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.\\nA mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.\\nA pure substance is made of only one type of matter. Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.\\nA mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.\\nThe crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.\\nHowever, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different! Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.\\nAquamarine is a mineral.\\nCotton is made by living things. But minerals are not made by living things.\\nCotton is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.\\nSo, cotton is not a mineral.\\nBiotite is a mineral.",

    "10352": "The answer is B. BECAUSE: A change is a physical change if the matter changes form but not composition. A change is a chemical change if the matter changes composition.\\nIn a physical change, the matter changes form but not composition. For example, when water freezes, it changes from a liquid to a solid. The composition of water (H2O) does not change when it freezes.\\nIn a chemical change, the composition of the matter changes. For example, when water evaporates, it changes from a liquid to a gas. The composition of water (H2O) does not change when it evaporates.\\nSo, a physical change is a change in form, and a chemical change is a change in composition.\\nNow look at the changes in the question.\\nWhen snails grow shells, they change form. Their bodies get bigger, and they develop a hard shell. But the composition of their bodies does not change. So, this is a physical change.\\nWhen plants do photosynthesis, the composition of their leaves changes. They take in carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) and use sunlight to make glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2). So, this is a chemical change.\\nThe two changes have the same cause: they are both chemical changes.",

For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals or rocks.\\nHumans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.\\nA mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.\\nA pure substance is made of only one type of matter. Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.\\nA mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.\\nThe crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.\\nHowever, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different! Compare the properties of hematite to the properties of minerals.

For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals or rocks.\\nHumans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.\\nA mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.\\nA pure substance is made of only one type of matter. Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.\\nA mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.\\nThe crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.\\nHowever, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different! Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.\\nSphalerite is a mineral.\\nPyrite is a mineral.\\nPaper is not a pure substance.

    "12824": "The answer is A. BECAUSE: A physical change is a change to a substance that does not change what the substance is. A chemical change is a change to a substance that does change what the substance is.\\nFor example, when you break a ceramic plate, the plate is still made of ceramic. So, breaking the plate is a physical change.\\nBut when you knit yarn into a scarf, the yarn is no longer just yarn. It is now a scarf. So, knitting the yarn is a chemical change.\\nNow look at the changes in the question.\\nWhen you break a ceramic plate, the plate is still made of ceramic. So, breaking the plate is a physical change.\\nWhen you knit yarn into a scarf, the scarf is still made of yarn.

There are two types of degrees:\\nCelsius degrees (\u00b0C)\\nFahrenheit degrees (\u00b0F)\\nThe Celsius and Fahrenheit scales are both used to measure temperature. But they use different numbers.\\nHere is how to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit degrees:\\nTo convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit: multiply by 1.8, then add 32\\nTo convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius: subtract 32, then divide by 1.8\\nFor example, the temperature of a hot day in the desert could be 48\u00b0C. To convert this to Fahrenheit, multiply 48 by 1.8, then add 32. This gives you an answer of 116.4\u00b0F.\\nOr, the temperature of a hot day in the desert could be 48\u00b0F.

For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals or rocks.\\nHumans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.\\nA mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.\\nA pure substance is made of only one type of matter. Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.\\nA mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.\\nThe crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.\\nHowever, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different! Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals.

For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals or rocks.\\nHumans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.\\nA mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.\\nA pure substance is made of only one type of matter. Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.\\nA mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.\\nThe crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.\\nHowever, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different! Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.\\nChrysotile is a mineral.\\nFluorite is a mineral.\\nCheese is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.\\nSo, cheese is not a mineral.",

    "20751": "The answer is B. BECAUSE: A trait is a feature of an organism. An organism gets its traits from its parents.\\nThe parents pass down traits to their offspring through their genes. Genes are special codes that determine how an organism will look and function.\\nEach parent has two genes for each trait. For example, one gene may determine the color of an organism's eyes, and the other gene may determine the shape of its eyes.\\nWhen the parents have a baby, they each pass one gene for each trait to the baby. So, the baby has two genes for each trait\u2014one from each parent.\\nThe two genes for each trait may be the same, or they may be different.\\nIf the two genes for a trait are the same, the trait is called homozygous.\\nIf the two genes for a trait are different, the trait is called heterozygous.\\nIn the example above, if both genes for eye color are blue, the eye color is homozygous blue.\\nIf one gene for eye color is blue and the other is brown, the eye color is heterozygous blue-brown.\\nThe gene that is expressed, or seen, is called the dominant gene.\\nThe gene that is not expressed, or seen, is called the recessive gene.\\nIn the example above, blue is the dominant gene, and brown is the recessive gene.\\nIf an organism has two different genes for a trait, the dominant gene will always be expressed.\\nSo, in the example above, the eye color would be blue, even though the brown gene is present.\\nThe only time the recessive gene will be expressed is when the organism has two of them.\\nSo, if an organism has two brown genes for eye color, the eye color will be brown.\\nNow, let's look at the information given in the question.\\nPeter has straight hair. This means that the gene for straight hair is dominant.\\nPeter's parents were born with straight hair. This means that they each have one gene for straight hair.\\nThey passed down this trait to Peter. This means that Peter has two genes for straight hair\u2014one from each parent.\\nSo, the conclusion that Peter inherited this trait is supported by the information given in the question.",
